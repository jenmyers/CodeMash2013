This is the readme for Straight-Up Design
============

You can find slides for "Straight-Up Design: Simple Ways for Devs To Make Apps Look and Work Better" at [my website](http://jenmyers.net/speaking), as well as slides and video from my earlier talk, "Developers Can't Design (And Other Completely Untrue Design Myths)," which includes a lot of complementary information.

You can also contact me with feedback or questions via email at <hello@jenmyers.net> or on Twitter at [@antiheroine](http://twitter.com/antiheroine).
